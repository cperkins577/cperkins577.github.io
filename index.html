        <p id="about-top">
            Born and raised in North Carolina, I graduated from the University
            of Alabama in 2020 in Physics. Focusing on Astrophysics, I found my passion for
            programming while writing scripts and programs for my high energy physics labs and
            I began to pursue a minor in Computer Science alongside Mathematics. Through college,
            I worked part-time at a local Chipotle in order to pay bills and save money, working on
            small personal projects and developing my programming skills on the side. Outside of class and
            after I graduated, I learned Javascript, HTML, CSS, and some React. Now I am focusing on C++
            and Unreal Engine, hoping to begin applying all that I have learned to another passion of mine: video games!

        <p id="about-bottom">
            I am currently living in Raleigh, North Carolina and working as an Assistant General Manager for
            a local restraunt. In my spare time I continue to learn and grow in any direction I can. In late 2024 I released
            my first complete game experience on Itch.io, and have done work involving animation state machines, UI handling,
            skeleton rigging, and regular gameplay programming, which is my focus. I work in both UE Blueprints and C++.

                These are a few clips of the various projects I have experimented with. I focus mostly on gameplay programming,
                so many of my projects involve different gameplay mechanics and exploring ways to improve my code to make it more modular and efficient.
                I am always looking for new subjects and challenges to tackle!
