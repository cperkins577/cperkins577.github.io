                Born and raised in North Carolina, I graduated from the University
                of Alabama in 2020 in Physics. Focusing on Astrophysics, I found my passion for
                programming while writing scripts and programs for my high energy physics labs and
                I began to pursue a minor in Computer Science alongside Mathematics. Through college,
                I worked part-time at a local Chipotle in order to pay bills and save money, working on
                small personal projects and developing my programming skills on the side. Outside of class and
                after I graduated, I learned Javascript, HTML, CSS, Godot, and some React. Now I am focusing on C++
                and Unreal Engine, hoping to begin applying all that I have learned to another passion of mine: video games!

                I am currently living in Raleigh, North Carolina and working as an Assistant General Manager for
                a local restraunt. In my spare time I continue to learn and grow in any direction I can. In late 2024 I released
                my first complete game experience on Itch.io, and have done work involving animation state machines, UI handling,
                skeleton rigging, and regular gameplay programming, which is my focus. I work in both UE Blueprints and C++.

            These are a few clips of the various projects I have experimented with. I focus mostly on gameplay programming,
            so many of my projects involve different gameplay mechanics and exploring ways to improve my code to make it more modular and efficient.
            I am always looking for new subjects and challenges to tackle!

                        Here is a clip of my first full game. It is a horror game where I focused on shadows and lighting. I also learned to create a
                        full menu screen and animate an intro. This was my first introduction to handling visual optimization as the game leaned heavily
                        on dynamic lighting. I had to learn how to fine tune the LOD distances to make sure the game ran at the desired rate. It is currently playable on itch.io.

                        On this project I focused on creating a souls-like gameplay system, with a lock-on camera and stamina regen system.
                        This was my first attempt at making connections between actor components and player UI. I used delegates to pass health information from the component, to the UI in blueprints.
                        This was an exercise in making clean, modular, and uncoupled connetions between components. This was the first time I had implemented a dynamic UI that reacted to player state.

                        Here I played around with mouse interactions and moving objects. This was a prototype for a game jam that was going to focus on sorting bugs into groups in a
                        timed setting. I needed a 3d setting and actors that would move around in random ways, and needed the ability to be picked up, moved, and placed without getting
                        stuck or overlapping. Also needed to make sure this action had visual feedback.

                    <p>
                        This was the prototype for another idea I wanted to eventually bring to a full game. It was a sticky grenade dodgeball game, with ragdoll deaths and eventually multiplayer.
                        Here I focused on creating my own animations and learning how to attach components to sockets as well as perform sphere traces to attach the grenade to the bones of the actors.
                        This was also an excercise in object-oriented programming, as I created a base grenade class that I would then derive other classes from to create different types of grenades.
                        I also toyed with creating impulses to create explosion effects, which as shown in the clip, had not yet begun to behave the way I intended.

                        This is a clip of a random dungeon and enemy generator I built in the Godot engine. This was my first ever project, and was the foundation of an attempt to create a rogue-like dungeon crawler.
                        It is a scalable system, with exposed variables that would determine the maximum number of rooms as well as the difficulty range of the rooms themselves.
                        This would determine the number and types of enemies spawned. The system also had a boss spawning system. As the generator filled out room branches, a script would keep note of the longest branch.
                        When the maximum number of rooms were spawned, or all available space was used, the script would then mark the room as an end room and spawn in a boss with the usual enemies.
